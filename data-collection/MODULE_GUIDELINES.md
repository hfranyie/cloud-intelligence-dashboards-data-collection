# Module Design Guidelines

How to decide *where* new data collection belongs and *what* to name the module.
The goal is to keep the number of modules small and their scope stable as coverage grows.

## 1. Decide which module the data belongs to

Classify by **what kind of data it is** and **how accounts/regions are selected** (the
collection topology), not by which dashboard consumes it.

| Data kind | Goes to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Inventory** — `describe_*` / `list_*` of live customer resources, per linked account | `module-inventory` | Add a new entry to the `AwsObjects` fan-out. Don't create a new module. |
| **Reference** — catalogs *not* tied to a specific customer resource (engine versions, EOL/lifecycle dates, region/service availability, instance-type metadata) | `module-reference` | Collected in the data-collection account only. |
| **Service-specific** — metrics, operational or lifecycle API calls for one service (CloudWatch metrics, pending maintenance, recommendations, …) | `module-<service>` | One module per service. See §2. |
| **Derived** — anything computed by joining datasets above | An Athena `NamedQuery` **view** | Never a new Lambda or module. |

If the data can be produced by joining tables that already exist, it is **derived** — write a
view. Collect raw data once; compute in Athena.

### Before adding any collection, check what is already collected

Duplicate collection is the most common mistake. **Before** writing a new Lambda, table, or
API call, `grep` the existing `module-*.yaml` for the service/attribute and confirm no module
already produces it. If it does, build a **view** over the existing table instead.

Already-collected data worth knowing about (not exhaustive — always verify against the files):

| You need… | It already exists in | Tables | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pricing** for EC2 / RDS / ElastiCache / OpenSearch (`AmazonES`) / Lambda / WorkSpaces / Savings Plans, incl. instance-type metadata | `module-pricing` | `pricing_<svc>_data` (`pricing_rds_data`, `pricing_ec2_data`, `pricing_elasticache_data`, `pricing_opensearch_data`, …) | Sourced from the **bulk Price List offer files**, not `pricing:GetProducts`. Flattened columns include `Instance Type`, `Instance Type Family`, `Current Generation`, `vCPU`, `Memory`, `Database Engine`, `Deployment Option`, and — for RDS/EC2 — **`Physical Processor`** (authoritative Intel/AMD/Graviton). Do **not** add a second pricing collector; prefer these columns over regex/suffix heuristics on instance names. |
| Instance-type hardware metadata (vCPU, memory, `ProcessorInfo.Manufacturer`, architectures) | `module-reference` | `ec2_instance_types` | Authoritative EC2 processor manufacturer. |
| Engine / EOL / version catalogs (RDS, ElastiCache) | `module-reference` | `rds_db_engine_versions`, `elasticache_engine_versions`, … | |
| Live customer resource inventory (`describe_*` / `list_*`) | `module-inventory` | per the `AwsObjects` fan-out | |

A cross-service KPI/mapping (e.g. instance generation, processor, upgrade path) is **derived**:
it should be an Athena view over the tables above, not a new Lambda or new pricing collection.

## 2. Service-specific modules: default to `module-<service>`

- **Default to one generic module per service** (`module-rds`, `module-workspaces`), holding
  *all* of that service's service-specific collection. Grow it by adding internal objects,
  the way `module-inventory` grew to many objects under one stack — the module count stays
  flat as scope increases.
- **Add a `-<facet>` suffix only when a hard boundary forces a separate stack**, i.e. the
  **collection topology differs**:
  - LINKED (cross-account member roles) vs. data-collection-account-only vs.
    management/payer-only vs. EUC account enumeration;
  - a facet that needs its own opt-in toggle;
  - an incompatible IAM boundary.

  A facet suffix is **not** justified by "the data is conceptually different" or "cleaner
  code" alone. Within one topology, consolidate.

- **Do not name a module after a verdict or a single API.** Avoid `health`, `optimization`,
  `compliance` (verdicts) and `metrics`, `usage`, `maintenance` (single facets) — they
  re-narrow a module that should stay generic.

- **Legacy exceptions are grandfathered.** `module-rds-usage` (RDS CloudWatch metrics) and
  `module-workspaces-metrics` keep their names; new RDS/WorkSpaces service-specific data
  consolidates into `module-rds` / `module-workspaces`.

### Worked examples

- **RDS** — instance metrics, pending maintenance, and future RDS API calls are all plain
  LINKED topology → one `module-rds`, no further splitting. (Version/EOL catalogs →
  `module-reference`; version-compliance status → an Athena view over inventory + reference.)
- **WorkSpaces** — genuinely splits, because topology differs: inventory →
  `module-inventory` (the `EUC` object); CloudWatch metrics → its own module because EUC
  account selection and opt-in differ from a standard LINKED service.

## 3. Naming must be consistent across all touch-points

For a module, the same token must appear in the filename facet, the `Include…Module`
parameter, the `Deploy…` condition, and the nested-stack logical id.

`module-rds-usage` is the counter-example to avoid: it is `rds-usage` (file) /
`IncludeRDSUtilizationModule` (parameter) / `DeployRDSUtilizationModule` (condition) /
`RDSUsageModule` (logical id) — three different tokens for one module.

## 4. Descriptions

Name the service and the **data category**, never the specific API — so the text stays true
as scope grows.

- **Module template** (`Description:`, line 2) — generic scope + topology:
  ```
  Description: Retrieves RDS operational and configuration data across the AWS organization
  ```
- **Deploy-stack parameter** (`Include…Module`) — user-facing opt-in, with a concrete example:
  ```
  Description: Collects RDS operational details (e.g. pending maintenance) from your accounts
  ```

Avoid the words `health`, `metrics`, `usage`, `utilization` in descriptions of generic
modules for the same reason as in names.

## 5. Wiring a new service-specific module

A new module must be registered in the deploy stacks following the existing contract:

- **`deploy/deploy-data-collection.yaml`**: `Include<Name>Module` parameter (+ `ParameterGroups`
  / `ParameterLabels` entries), a `Deploy<Name>Module` condition, and a nested
  `<Name>Module` `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` gated on that condition.
- **`deploy/deploy-in-linked-account.yaml`** (for LINKED collection): matching
  `Include<Name>ModulePolicy` condition, a least-privilege `AWS::IAM::Policy`, and the
  assume-role trust for `${ResourcePrefix}<name>-LambdaRole`.
- **`deploy/deploy-in-management-account.yaml`**: only if the module reads
  management/payer-account data. LINKED-only modules do **not** touch this stack.
